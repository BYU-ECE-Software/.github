Bio: When I'm not coding, I love playing ultimate frisbee, reading, attending BYU sporting events, and watching Dancing with the Stars. I am originally from Wisconsin, and I am about to start an integrated IS Masters program in the fall!  | Bio: Driven by a passion for coding and electronics, I thrive on learning new skills and solving complex problems. Whether I'm tinkering with tech or diving into a new project, I’m always seeking ways to innovate. When I’m not behind a screen, you’ll find me on the golf course or shooting hoops—sports keep me energized and balanced. | Bio:

3. Email Roman (romanv7@byu.edu) with your net ID, BYU ID, github username, and what projects you will be working on (professors should know)
4. Check your BYU email for an invitation to join the Github Organization, and accept!
**OR**
5. Log in to Github, and there should be something that can tell you to accept the invite from within the browser (untested, someone get back to me if this works for you)
